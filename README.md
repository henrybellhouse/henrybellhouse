### Hello, I am Henry!

I love Statistics, Experimental Design and scaling great products to be loved by as many users as possible. In particular, Decision Science is a good explanation of the work I conduct, looking to better understand user behaviour in every step of the product development process, relaying insights to Product Managers and Engineers, and acting as their compass.

My educational background is in Economics at University College London, where I concentrated in Behavioural Economics and Econometrics and received First Class Honours (approx. GPA of 3.85 on 4.0 scale). Here, I ran a student-led Venture Capital fund and sourced, evaluated and supported startups in eCommerce, Social Selling and FinTech spaces.

My professional work began in Product Analytics for a global eCommerce/FinTech company where I developed a comprehensive Customer Segmentation solution using an (Unsupervised) Machine Learning model. Furthermore, I utilised pre-existing Python packages to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to evaluate which users were most valuable. I then took a deep-dive into the company's Shopping Products and helped to track and evaluate the rollout of their Social Commerce platform for creators.

Currently, I work on Marketing Data Science and Analytics for a Series A FinTech which has tripled its customer base over the previous year. Here, I am building out the 'gold standard' for approaching Product-led Growth and Experimentation, while supporting the Head of Marketing in evaluating new channels/strategies to improve customer acquisition and demand generation.
